# Review Console

Mode: Operate. Implement the existing six-screen prototype and docs/design/07-web-console.md.
Audience: administrators and read-only viewers inspecting GitLab review evidence.
The API is the source of truth; fixture data belongs only in tests. No new interview
or visual choice is claimed. The brief already pins structure and visual identity.

## Direction contract

THESIS: A review is traceable from proposal through challenge to disposition. Keep
the existing working console, not a marketing dashboard or a new visual world.

OWN-WORLD: Preserve the prototype's charcoal navigation, blue actions, cool light
canvas, white panels, restrained borders, Chinese sans labels, and monospace code.
Status uses both text and color. Provide a corresponding dark theme.

STORY: Find a run, inspect the execution graph, read the evidence and challenge,
then act on a failure or publication. Administrators can register projects and
maintain context; viewers cannot change state.

FIRST VIEWPORT: Desktop keeps a narrow left navigation and a wide content area.
The overview leads with current runs and required attention, followed by recent
reviews. A review detail leads with MR identity and status, a layered execution
graph, and a filterable findings table. Node selection opens its evidence drawer.
At 390px the navigation collapses; tables and the graph scroll inside their region.

FORM: Existing prototype implementation, not a concept competition. Seed not
applicable: the user-approved project specification pins the visual reference.
The signature interaction is selecting a graph node to inspect its structured
output and model-call evidence without losing the review's overall state.

FINISH: unreviewed and undocumented is unfinished; this build ends with the finish review, the verdict, DESIGN.md, and every shipping raster carrying its provenance

Unresolved: real GitLab OAuth and production data require deployment credentials.
Browser verification will use explicitly identified local fixtures, not claim a
real GitLab or LLM-provider integration. No raster assets are required.
